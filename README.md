# MatrixAlgorithms

_Staging area for matrix algebra algorithms_

<p align="justify">This repository is a staging area for matrix algebra functions, along with Julia bindings for testing. Every line of code on this repository wants to eventually find a home in some linear algebra package. This is a hobbyist's repository.</p>

<p align="justify">Contributions in the form of code and documentation are welcome and will help speed up upstream submissions.</p>

<p align="justify">Note: These functions are not intended to be used directly and the author discourages such use. But the author is also aware that he cannot tell the world what to do.</p>
