# LAPACKExtensions.jl
_Staging area for LAPACK extensions_

<p align="justify">This repository is a staging area for future LAPACK functions, along with Julia bindings for testing. Every line of code on this repositry wants to eventually find a home in LAPACK.
Contributions in the form of code and documentation are welcome and will help speed up submissions to https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack. This is a hobbyist's repository.
These functions are not intended to be used directly and the author discourages such use. But the author is also aware that he cannot tell the world what to do.</p>
