_Staging area for linear algebra extensions to numerical linear algebra packages_

<p align="justify">This repository is a staging area for future numerical linear algebra functions, along with Julia bindings for testing. Every line of code on this repository wants to eventually find a home in some linear algebra package.
Contributions in the form of code and documentation are welcome and will help speed up upstream submissions. This is a hobbyist's repository.
These functions are not intended to be used directly and the author discourages such use. But the author is also aware that he cannot tell the world what to do.</p>
